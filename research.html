                    <h4>AI for Drug Design</h4>
                    <p>
                        Drug discovery is the process of finding useful compounds that have a therapeutic effect towards
                        a
                        health
                        condition. It aims to select molecules that satisfy multiple pharmacodynamic properties (e.g.,
                        specific
                        binding to a target) and pharmacokinetic properties (e.g., absorption, distribution, metabolism,
                        excretion,
                        and toxicity), while ensuring efficacy and safety. This process is expensive, time-consuming,
                        and
                        with a
                        high
                        degree of uncertainty regarding the likelihood of a drug's success. The chance of identifying
                        one
                        molecule
                        that fulfills all requirements, in a massive library and following sequential screening steps,
                        is
                        rather
                        rare.
                        The search space is huge up to 10⁶⁰ and brutally enumerating each molecule is computational
                        infeasible. On
                        average, it takes billions of dollars and more than 10 years to successfully have a drug reach
                        the
                        approval
                        stage. The recent rise of AI techniques has provided a promising opportunity to revolutionise
                        the
                        drug
                        discovery process.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At the BMDS Lab, new AI approaches have been developed to design drug candidates that
                        simultaneously
                        satisfy
                        multiple properties. For example, the deep evolutionary learning (DEL) approach published in
                        [3,4]
                        combines
                        the strengths of deep generative models and multi-objective evolutionary computing to design
                        novel
                        molecules
                        for cancer treatment. To optimise drug efficacy, combat drug resistance, and reduce side effects
                        in
                        cancer
                        therapy, we propose a two-birds-with-one-stone approach to design drugs that can target multiple
                        drug
                        targets.
                        Below shows a compound (generated using the Lab's multi-target drug design method) that can bind
                        two
                        targets
                        for breast cancer treatment.

                    </div>
                    <p>
                        From the computing perspective, drug design is a multi-objective optimisation problem [1]. One
                        particular
                        task
                        is lead optimisation which aims at modifying a given lead molecule of interest such that the
                        desired
                        properties can be improved and the unwanted properties minimised. Below demonstrates an example.
                        The
                        lead
                        compound (left) has favourable SAS (synthetic accessibility score) property, but poor solubility
                        in
                        water
                        (clogP) and drug-likeness (QED). After modification using BMDS' multi-objective reinforcement
                        learning
                        (MORL)
                        approach, the new compound (right) has all properties favourable.

                        analytics play
                        an
                        important role in scientific discovery. The BMDS Lab builds AI models for a variety of
                        biomedical
                        image
                        analysis tasks, such as object segmentation and image classification. In collaboration with the
                        8Trees Inc.,
                        an environmental organisation in Font Hill Ontario, AI models are being developed to identify
                        and
                        track
                        individual Massasauga rattlesnakes, an endangered species in South Ontario. Snake IDing is a
                        challenging
                        task
                        due to their high-similar skin patterns and flexible body shape. From the two snake pictures
                        below,
                        are you
                        able to tell whether they are from the same individual or two different ones? AI can tell.

                    <h4>Machine Learning</h4>
                    <p>
                        As an important pillar of AI, machine learning aims at building a parameterised model of our
                        “world”
                        of
                        interest, learning its parameters using training examples and experiences, and then generalising
                        its
                        capability to unseen data. At the BMDS Lab, a variety of novel machine learning models have been
                        devised to
                        tackle specific tasks, such as deep feature selection (DFS) for cis-regulatory element
                        prediction
                        and
                        characterisation, multi-class non-negative matrix factorisation for identifying shared pathways
                        and
                        tumor-specific pathways in pan-cancer analysis, and multi-modal generative models for data
                        integration.

                    <h4>Looking Forward</h4>
                    <p>
                        At the BMDS Lab, we aim to push the boundaries of biomedical data science through impactful and
                        interdisciplinary research.
                        We actively seek new collaborations across academia, industry, and government sectors to
                        translate our innovations into real-world solutions.

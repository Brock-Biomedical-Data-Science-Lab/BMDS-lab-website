        <h4>AI for Drug Design</h4>
        <p>
          Drug discovery is the process of finding useful compounds that have a therapeutic effect towards a health
          condition. It aims to select molecules that satisfy multiple pharmacodynamic properties (e.g., specific
          binding to a target) and pharmacokinetic properties (e.g., absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion,
          and toxicity), while ensuring efficacy and safety. This process is expensive, time-consuming, and with a high
          degree of uncertainty regarding the likelihood of a drug's success. The chance of identifying one molecule
          that fulfills all requirements, in a massive library and following sequential screening steps, is rather rare.
          The search space is huge up to 10⁶⁰ and brutally enumerating each molecule is computational infeasible. On
          average, it takes billions of dollars and more than 10 years to successfully have a drug reach the approval
          stage. The recent rise of AI techniques has provided a promising opportunity to revolutionise the drug
          discovery process.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the BMDS Lab, new AI approaches have been developed to design drug candidates that simultaneously satisfy
          multiple properties. For example, the deep evolutionary learning (DEL) approach published in [3,4] combines
          the strengths of deep generative models and multi-objective evolutionary computing to design novel molecules
          for cancer treatment. To optimise drug efficacy, combat drug resistance, and reduce side effects in cancer
          therapy, we propose a two-birds-with-one-stone approach to design drugs that can target multiple drug targets.
          Below shows a compound (generated using the Lab's multi-target drug design method) that can bind two targets
          for breast cancer treatment.

        </div>
        <p>
          From the computing perspective, drug design is a multi-objective optimisation problem [1]. One particular task
          is lead optimisation which aims at modifying a given lead molecule of interest such that the desired
          properties can be improved and the unwanted properties minimised. Below demonstrates an example. The lead
          compound (left) has favourable SAS (synthetic accessibility score) property, but poor solubility in water
          (clogP) and drug-likeness (QED). After modification using BMDS' multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL)
          approach, the new compound (right) has all properties favourable.

        <h4>Biomedical Image Analysis</h4>
        <p>
          From images captured under microscopes to images taken in filed trips, image processing and analytics play an
          important role in scientific discovery. The BMDS Lab builds AI models for a variety of biomedical image
          analysis tasks, such as object segmentation and image classification. In collaboration with the 8Trees Inc.,
          an environmental organisation in Font Hill Ontario, AI models are being developed to identify and track
          individual Massasauga rattlesnakes, an endangered species in South Ontario. Snake IDing is a challenging task
          due to their high-similar skin patterns and flexible body shape. From the two snake pictures below, are you
          able to tell whether they are from the same individual or two different ones? AI can tell.

        <h4>Machine Learning</h4>
        <p>
          As an important pillar of AI, machine learning aims at building a parameterised model of our “world” of
          interest, learning its parameters using training examples and experiences, and then generalising its
          capability to unseen data. At the BMDS Lab, a variety of novel machine learning models have been devised to
          tackle specific tasks, such as deep feature selection (DFS) for cis-regulatory element prediction and
          characterisation, multi-class non-negative matrix factorisation for identifying shared pathways and
          tumor-specific pathways in pan-cancer analysis, and multi-modal generative models for data integration.
        </p>
        <p>
          The BMDS group builds foundation models that can do multiple tasks and conversational AI models that can
          generate better responses given instructions. See below a demonstration.
